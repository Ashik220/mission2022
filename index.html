          <h2>Stay safe with <span class="green">Green.</span></h2>
          <p>The green lifestyle is an all-encompassing term of green living. The green lifestyle generally refers to an
            individual who has chosen to make changes in all aspects of their lifestyle from a consumer and
            chemical-based lifestyle to a green lifestyle that supports ecological development and eco-friendly
            endeavors. A green lifestyle can take years to develop and is not a lifestyle that occurs overnight. There
            is a large misconception that the green lifestyle is something that you can implement in a weekend and
            continue to live over time. Though a green lifestyle can begin to be implemented over a weekend, maintaining
            that lifestyle and developing a lifestyle that works best for you or your family's needs can take time and
            dedication. The time and dedication does however pay off with several benefits of going green.</p>
